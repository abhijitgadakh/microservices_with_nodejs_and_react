# microservices_with_nodejs_and_react
This repository contains my practice work and assignments from the Udemy course Microservices with Node.js and React. The project focuses on building a scalable e-commerce application using a microservices architecture. Key technologies include Node.js, Express, React, Next.js, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes. The repo covers key microservices patterns, event-driven communication, JWT-based authentication, API gateway management, and best practices for distributed systems. Each service operates independently and communicates via an event bus, ensuring flexibility and scalability. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in architecting production-ready microservices applications.
